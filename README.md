## Logs

1. [x] Home Page: This page has dropdowns in the banner at the top  of the page and 3 major categories in red (Pacific Commercial Partners, Our Services, and Property Search)
   1. [x] Under “Our Services”… if you click on “Development & Entitlement” nothing comes up.  If you go to the “Services Offered” in the top banner, you get the same list, but there is verbiage under “Entitlement Services” … copy that verbiage and use it under “Development and Entitlement”.
2. [x] Under “Property Search” change the lead paragraph to:
   1. [x] “Please identify any listed KW Commercial property for Sale or Lease that you are interested in and we will thoroughly research the market and provide you with a report indicating our opinion of the value of the investment, the competitive Sale or Lease values in the market, and alternate market opportunities we identify that meet your criteria. We will represent you in any Sale or Lease opportunity and the Seller or Building Owner will compensate us through their listing agent at no cost to you. We can also search multiple national commercial listing services for you.”
3. [x] Jason… if you need to use a slightly smaller font to make this work, that’s ok.
4. [x] In the “TEAM BIO” dropdown, eliminate the Bio for Heather Mattlin- I am asking the other team members to submit any changes they wish to make in their individual bios and will get those to you as available.
5. [x] In the “PROPERTY” dropdown on the Home Page, let’s change the title to “YOUR PROPERTY INFO & PROPERTY SEARCH” and
