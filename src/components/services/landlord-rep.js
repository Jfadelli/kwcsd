                        <p>There are nearly always options available to tenants in the marketplace. As vacancies have increase, which are on the rise in some product types,, Landlords are working hard to keep existing tenants. In this arena of competition between Landlords, it becomes imperative to have an aggressive marketing program tailored to the specific needs of the tenants in the marketplace while also balancing the financial goals of the property owner.</p><br />

                        <p>Our Southern California advisory team is very selective in taking agency assignments. We recognize the value of our contribution to the assignment and work with landlords that are ready to be positioned for success.</p><br />

                        <p>Accountability is also an important component of our marketing plan, as we keep our
                            clients informed of all activity through regular reporting, meetings and discussions to the degree that is most desirable to the client.</p><br />

                        <p>It has been confirmed through our experience that tenants are largely located within the "shadow" of a project. We will identify and pursue select tenants whom best fit with each listing through a proactive and coordinated approach. In a planned and concentrated effort, we chart and develop a relationship with the proper class of tenant within a 5-mile "shadow" radius of every listing. In addition to pursuing local tenants, KW commercial will place significant emphasis on marketing to the local commercial real estate broker community. This outreach leverages the tenant contacts and relationships of the entire commercial community to secure the best possible tenants for our clients.</p><br />
